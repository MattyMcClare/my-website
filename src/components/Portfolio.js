            <p>From the young age, my parents thought me that nothing is imposible, you just need to work for it. With that in mind I've always followed my own path and became open-minded and creative individual. At some point I decided to move to Scotland to start studying Sound Production on Edinburgh College. Amongst my various interests I descovered my true passion - coding. After enrolling in the Software Developer course at CodeClan I started to improve skills and learn new technologies. Below is some of my recent work.</p>
